# About Me

I am currently a first year Ph.D. student at The George Washington University in the [GWUSEC lab](https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/). 
My research interests lie primarily within the areas of Mobile Security, Cyber Crime, and the intersection of Machine Learning with security. In time outside of research, I enjoy expanding my skills within the areas of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), reverse engineering, and malware analysis.

I graduated with my Master's  and Bachelor's degree  in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in May 2021. While at UIUC, I had the opportunity to partake in the Cybercorps Scholarship for Service. Through my coursework, I gained technical skills relating to binary exploitation, network exploitation, web application exploitation, and digital forensics. I also had the opportunity to learn how machine learning can be utilized for various domains in Cyber Security and learned about adversarial machine learning.
