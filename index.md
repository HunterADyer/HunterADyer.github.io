# About Me
I am a cybersecurity reasearch interested in reverse-engineering, malware analysis,  application security & analysis, and Android security. My reverse-engineering interests are widespread (ranging from firmware, to IOT, to video games), but I am particularly interested in understanding the malware (Android and Windows) that is packaged and targeted towards deceiving consumers of a particular product (e.g. an Android application meant to be a poor replica or copy of a popular game).

# Projects, Write-Ups, and Other Work

I keep a log of security research and work that I have done in my own personal time on my [projects](index.md) page. 

Work that is detailed on this page is done in my own time, of my own liberty. All opinions, statements, and results are my own and in no way represent those of my employers.

# Interests and Hobbies

Though not a subject of technical work, I enjoy observing and learning about anti-cheat systems that are implemented for video games, and how cheats evolve to defeat them.

Outside of security research and work, I enjoy working with AI generative art models, 3D printing very large models (when not fixing the printers), and working on FPV & photography drones! I've also begun working on developing a set-up and workflow for digital preservation of media. I'm particularly fond of old documents and journals that are found during genealogy research. I also enjoy looking at old TIME and National Geographic magazines.

Contact information and more professional details can be found in my CV below. I am always excited to discuss topics mentioned above, and any beyond.

# Prior Work
Previously, I enjoyed working with the folks at The George Washington University in the [GWUSEC lab](https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/) for the 2021-2022 academic year. Here I had the opportunity to work with excellent collaborators on projects relating to mobile PINs, victim responses to data breaches, and internet measurement work within the domain of Android applications. I am always open to any research collaborations in the realm of security, especially if it involves Android security or reverse-engineering!
