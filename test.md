### Twitter Bots and Misinformation Within The 2020 Presidential Election
##### *University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - August 2020 - December 2020*
- Explored automated classification of misinformation tweets through Word2Vec distance metrics from Snopes and PolitiFact articles
- Leveraged existing social media bot classifier to identify magnitude of bot presence on political accounts found in Snopes and PolitiFact, hashtags, and election related conversation

### Utilizing Adversarial Machine Learning Against DeepFakes
##### *University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - August 2020 - December 2020*
- Utilized AdvGAN with various loss functions to generate protective adversarial noise in order to combat against AutoEncoder DeepFakes
- Explored the effects of loss functions on other image translation task, such as Pix2Pix (Facade) and CycleGAN (Horse2Zebra)
